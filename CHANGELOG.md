## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-25

### ðŸŽ¯ **MAJOR REDESIGN** - From Bot to Personal Auto-Corrector

#### Added
- **Personal Auto-Correction**: Intercepts MY messages before sending (not a bot anymore)
- **DM Intelligence**: Automatically detects pronouns in DMs without requiring @mentions
- **Multiple Correction Modes**: 
  - Auto-correct: Silently fixes pronouns and sends corrected message
  - Block & warn: Prevents sending and shows me what's wrong
  - Ask first: Shows corrections and asks for approval
- **Smart Context Detection**: Analyzes message context to reduce false positives
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only corrects when confident about the mismatch (60-95% threshold)
- **Multiple Pronoun Sources**: PronounDB, Discord Bio (planned), custom APIs
- **Real-time Notifications**: Toast messages when corrections happen
- **Personal Statistics**: Track my correction behavior and progress
- **Advanced Settings**: 10+ customization options for personalized experience

#### Technical Improvements
- **Pre-send Interception**: Uses `addPreSendListener` to catch messages before they send
- **DM Context Awareness**: Detects DM channels and assumes pronouns refer to recipient
- **Proper Vencord Integration**: Fixed API usage (`options` instead of `settings`)
- **Memory Management**: Proper listener cleanup and cache management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback
- **Performance Optimized**: 5-minute pronoun caching, minimal API calls

#### Changed
- **From Bot to Client-Side Tool**: No longer sends correction messages to chat
- **Privacy-Focused**: Only affects my own messages, nobody else sees corrections
- **First-Person Perspective**: All code and documentation written as if I'm speaking
- **Vencord-Specific**: Optimized specifically for Vencord's plugin system

#### Removed
- **Bot Behavior**: No more public correction messages in chat
- **Other User Monitoring**: Only processes my own messages
- **Complex Duplicate Tracking**: Simplified to focus on personal use
- **Public Commands**: No slash commands visible to others

### Breaking Changes

- **File Structure**: New file organization and naming
- **Settings Format**: All settings need to be reconfigured

### Migration Guide

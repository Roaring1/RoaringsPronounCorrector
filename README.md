 üîß Technical Details

 Context Awareness Algorithm

The plugin uses sophisticated context analysis:

1. Pronoun Extraction: Identifies all pronouns with positions
2. Context Analysis: Examines surrounding text for confidence
3. Mention Correlation: Links pronouns to nearby user mentions
4. False Positive Filtering: Skips quotes, references, fictional content
5. Confidence Scoring: Calculates likelihood of intentional misgendering

 Confidence Factors

Increases Confidence (+)
- Pronouns at sentence start
- Pronouns followed by verbs ("he is", "she said")
- Personal context words ("person", "friend", "colleague")

Decreases Confidence (-)
- Media references ("movie", "song", "character")
- Quoted text or code blocks
- URLs and external references

 Data Sources

 PronounDB Integration
- Fetches from `pronoundb.org/api/v1/lookup`
- Supports all standard pronoun formats
- 5-minute caching with automatic cleanup

 Custom API Format
Your API should return:
```json
{
  "pronouns": "she/her"
}
```

Replace `{userId}` in your URL: `https://api.example.com/pronouns/{userId}`

 Performance

- Memory: ~2-5MB for typical usage
- Network: Minimal (cached requests)
- CPU: Lightweight regex parsing
- Storage: In-memory only (no persistent data)

 üö® Troubleshooting

 Common Issues

Plugin not loading:
- Ensure all files are in correct directory
- Check console for TypeScript errors
- Verify Vencord version compatibility

No corrections appearing:
- Check if plugin is enabled
- Verify confidence threshold isn't too high
- Test with `/pc-test` command

Too many/few corrections:
- Adjust confidence requirement (Settings)
- Enable/disable context awareness
- Modify cooldown settings

PronounDB not working:
- Check internet connection
- Verify API isn't rate-limited
- Try custom API as backup

 Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in settings to get detailed console logs:

1. Settings ‚Üí PronounCorrector ‚Üí Debug Mode: `true`
2. Open Developer Console (F12)
3. Look for `[PronounCorrector]` messages

 Performance Issues

If experiencing lag:
- Increase confidence threshold to reduce processing
- Disable context awareness temporarily
- Clear caches with `/pc-clear cache`
